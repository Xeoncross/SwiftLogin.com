<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>SwiftLogin is a secure user login and registration system based on 
email addresses. Unlike other identity systems, SwiftLogin is 
incredibility easy to setup. A simple and quick 
solution for both site owners and end users.</p>

<p>The end of complex, frustrating registration forms.</p><!--  and bogus spam accounts.</p> -->

<!-- 
for anyone with an email address.</p> -->
<!-- 
It is a signup 
system that removes the need for users to re-register on each new site 
and memorize passwords. With SwiftLogin someone can join your community 
in seconds!</p> -->

<h2>Why use it?</h2>

<p>Many sites often waste a users time (<i>or even scare them away</i>) by
asking for personal information before they can register on a site. SwiftLogin
solves this problem by asking for the only piece of info that really matters - an email.</p>

<p>Emails contain a username, contact address, website, and profile 
image (through <a href="http://gravatar.com">gravatar</a>) providing 
all the basic information required to allow someone access to your site.</p>

<p>SwiftLogin users can login to your site with a single click - 
<i>eliminating the registration process completly!</i></p>

<p>It's time sign-up forms die.</p>


<h2>What else does it do?</h2>

<p>Each user's SwiftLogin reputation follows them when they login to your
site allowing you to give special rights to users who have been
prased by other online communities.</p>

<p>SwiftLogin also monitors registrations in real time to insure
that spam bots are stopped before they ever reach your site.</p>



<!-- 
In addition, swiftlogin.com keeps records of suspected spam addresses 
for consumer sites to analyze as needed. The result is more real user 
accounts and less spam. For more information on how to add swiftlogin 
to your site check out the <a href="api.php">API</a> page.</p> -->
