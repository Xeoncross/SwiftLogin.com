## SwiftLogin Source Code

SwiftLogin.com started as a revolutionary idea to change the way we prove our identity online. Unlike existing protocols (like OpenID and OAuth), or SSO services (like Facebook and Twitter), SwiftLogin centered around user emails' and removed the need for site registration.

Launched in March 2011, SwiftLogin paved the way for later services such as http://BrowserID.org which is now [Mozilla Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/).
