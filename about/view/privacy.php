<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Before you get started with the lengthy monologue below, please note that SwiftLogin is a Sign-Sign-On (SSO) and email verification service. We try our best to collect as little information as possible, but what we do collect we often share, since that is the purpose of this site. If you have questions please email <a href="mailto:support@swiftlogin.com">support@swiftlogin.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like most website operators, SwiftLogin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SwiftLogin’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SwiftLogin’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SwiftLogin may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>SwiftLogin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. SwiftLogin only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Certain visitors to SwiftLogin’s websites choose to interact with SwiftLogin in ways that require SwiftLogin to gather personally-identifying information. For example, we ask visitors who sign-up to provide their email address. In each case, SwiftLogin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SwiftLogin. SwiftLogin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>SwiftLogin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SwiftLogin may monitor the most popular email domains to help identify spam. SwiftLogin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SwiftLogin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>SwiftLogin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to sites you attempt to login to. The sharing of your information to enhance third party registration and login is the main purpose of this site. SwiftLogin makes no warranties or claims about how these sites will use this information. <!--However, we will never share your information with another site unless you approve the request or the site is run by SwiftLogin's contractors or affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SwiftLogin’s behalf or to provide services to SwiftLogin’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. These contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SwiftLogin’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.--> <b>SwiftLogin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</b> SwiftLogin may also disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information when required to do so by law, or when SwiftLogin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SwiftLogin, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the SwiftLogin website and have supplied your email address, SwiftLogin may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SwiftLogin. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SwiftLogin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>


<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. SwiftLogin uses cookies to help SwiftLogin identify and track visitors, their usage of SwiftLogin website, and their website access preferences. SwiftLogin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SwiftLogin’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of this website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, SwiftLogin may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in SwiftLogin’s sole discretion. SwiftLogin encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
